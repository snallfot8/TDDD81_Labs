R(A,B,C,D,E)

FD1: (A,B,C) => (D,E)
FD2: (B,C,D) => (A,E)
FD3: (C) => (D) (not in bcnf)

Decomposing R into R1 and R2:

R1 = (C,D), FD1: (C) => (D), ck = C (BCNF)
R2 = (A,B,C,E), FD2: (A,B,C) => (E) (BCNF)

Augmentation on FD3 with (B,C) =>
FD4: (B,C) => (B,C,D) 

Transistivity of FD2 and F4:
(B,C) => (B,C,D) and (B,C,D) => (A,E) means that (B,C) => (A,E) (FD5)

R2 has FDs FD2 and FD5:
(A, B, C) => (E),    (B, C)=> (A, E), ck = (B,C)
